//read the numbers from the file
//declare two arrays, one for left and another for right
//parse through the numbers and save the left column numbers in left array and similarly for the right
//find the minimum value from both the arrays and calculate their difference
//store the difference somewhere
//remove the minimum values once the difference is calculated
//now repeast the process until there are no elements in the array
